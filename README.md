Arduinologger2
=======

Arduinologger2 is an Arduino-based datalogger for I2C sensor devices.

Arduinologger2 is developed as an open source project and uses the permissive business-friendly [BSD 2-Clause License](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) for maximum flexibility of use to the Arduinologger2 community. The goal of the project is to create a superior high-speed multi-sensor data logger.

Arduinologger2 was originally created as an Arduino Sketch before being migrated to an Atmel Studio 7 solution in March 2016. Active development is now being done in the Arduino branch, starting with the last Arduino release and backporting new functionality from the final AS7 solution. Once feature parity has been achieved, it is expected new development and maintainenance will only be done in the Arduino branch.
