Arduinologger2
=======

Arduinologger2 is an Arduino-based datalogger for I2C sensor devices.

Arduinologger2 is developed as an open source project and uses the permissive business-friendly [BSD 2-Clause License](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) for maximum flexibility of use to the Arduinologger2 community. The goal of the project is to create a superior high-speed multi-sensor data logger.

2018-09-30 A new project goal is to use Arduino Software only for development. Active development is now being done in the Arduino branch, created from the last commit in the master branch before migrating to Atmel Studio. New functionality in the master branch is being backported to the Arduino branch, and once feature parity is achieved new development and maintainenance will continue in the Arduino branch only.
